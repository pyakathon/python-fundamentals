# Data Analyst & Machine Learning Portfolio
## Overview
This repository serves as a personal portfolio showcasing my progress and completed work for  the Complete Data Analyst Bootcamp. The goal is to document my journey, track my skill development, and provide a clear overview of the projects and assignments that demonstrate my proficiency in various data-related tasks.

The repository is structured to be a living document that grows with my skills. Each project and assignment is a step towards building a comprehensive skill set, from data cleaning to advanced analytics, research.

## Skills & Technologies
This portfolio will demonstrate my capabilities in the following areas:
* **Programming Languages:** Python, SQL
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI, Excel
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, supervised and unsupervised models
* **Project Management:** Using Agile methodologies for project execution
* **Problem-Solving:** Applying a structured, data-driven approach to tackle complex challenges

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into two main folders to keep the assignments and larger projects separate and easy to navigate.
* **assignments/:** This folder contains smaller, focused assignments and exercises from the course curriculum. Each assignment will have its own sub-folder.
* **projects/:** This folder is dedicated to the larger, more complex projects that serve as key milestones in the course. Each project has its own sub-folder with a dedicated README file for detailed project-specific information.
